Report for labwork 2

First of all, I ran 02.practical.work.gethostbyname.c on my computer.
Here is the result:

khangthainguyen@Orp-koobcaM netprog2021 % ./a.out
 Please enter hostname: 
google.com
IP address is: 
172.217.161.174

khangthainguyen@Orp-koobcaM netprog2021 % ./a.out
 Please enter hostname: 
usth.edu.vn
IP address is:

khangthainguyen@Orp-koobcaM netprog2021 % ./a.out
 Please enter hostname: 
github.com
IP address is: 
192.30.255.112


Then, I connected to my VM and ran the same file on it. 
Here is the result:

When running on my computer, google.com has only 1 IP address while it has 6 different IP addresses when I ran on my VM.
On the other hand, both usth.edu.vn and github.com have the same IP address (119.17.215.232 for usth.edu.vn and 192.30.255.112
for github.com) on both of my computer and my VM.
